# Project-4-Survival-Analysis-of-Heart-Failure-Clinical-Data

This project involved a detailed statistical investigation of a heart failure clinical dataset (n = 299) to examine survival outcomes and the role of high blood pressure in patient mortality. The analysis was carried out entirely in SAS, ensuring reproducibility and rigorous statistical standards.

Data preparation included structured importing, validation, and preliminary exploration to ensure accuracy of variables and consistency of records. Kaplan-Meier survival curves, generated using PROC LIFETEST, provided a clear visual comparison of survival probabilities between patients with and without high blood pressure.

Statistical testing through the log-rank and Wilcoxon tests revealed no significant difference in survival distributions between the two groups (p > 0.05). This finding underscores the importance of verifying clinical assumptions through data-driven methods rather than relying solely on expected risk factors.

The study concludes that, within this dataset, high blood pressure alone does not appear to significantly influence survival in heart failure patients, highlighting the need for multivariable analysis in future studies. The results were presented with clear, publication-quality visualisations and precise interpretations suitable for clinical and research decision-making.
