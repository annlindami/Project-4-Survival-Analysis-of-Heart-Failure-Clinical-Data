# Project-4-Survival-Analysis-of-Heart-Failure-Clinical-Data

Analyzed survival patterns in 299 heart failure patients using Kaplan–Meier curves and Cox regression in SAS. Key findings before standardization showed high blood pressure, age, low ejection fraction, and high serum creatinine as major mortality risk factors.

After standardizing continuous variables (mean = 0, SD = 1), the model became easier to interpret — hazard ratios now reflected the risk change per one standard deviation. This revealed:

Ejection fraction as the strongest protective factor.

Serum creatinine as the most important risk factor.

Scale bias reduction, with variables like age losing inflated importance.

Impact: Standardization improved effect size comparability, reduced scale-driven bias, and provided clearer clinical insights. With complete data, the standardized model could retain its power while offering more reliable and interpretable results.
